With my virtual environment activated, 
'pip install Django==1.11.9' simply installed Django version 1.11.9 and pytz from 05/2018.
'pip list' lists all packages currently installed and their version.
'deactivate' deactivates my Python 3 virtual environment.
'pip3 list' lists ALL packages and versions, not just Python 3 related packages.
'source py3Env/bin/activate' reactivates my Python 3 virtual environment.
'pip install Django==1.11.9' for a second time returns that requirement already satisfied for the package, and nothing is installed or overwritten.
'pip freeze' returns Django==1.11.9 and pytz==2018.5. It seems to return a standard requirement format of the pip list call, excluding editables/packages pip depends on.
'pip freeze > requirements.txt' outputs a txt file to my current working directory containing the 'pip freeze' output.
'pip uninstall Django' uninstalls the Django package.
'pip show Django' did nothing.
'pip search Flask' searches the pip library for all Flask packages and outputs them with version and a brief description.
